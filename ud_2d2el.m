%% Student's code
%
%   You will implement the following three classes that will inherit from their corresponding first order
%   analysis classes as shown below:
%
%       [your initials]_Analysis_2d2el < RC_Analysis_2d1el
%       [your initials]_Element_2d2el < RC_Element_2d1el
%       [your initials]_Node_2d2el < RC_Node_2d1el
%
%   Your code must replace these few lines of code below...
% 
        Analysis=ABHI_Analysis_2d2el(nnodes, coord, fixity, concen, nele,...
            ends, A, Ayy, Izz, E, v, truss,numsteps,ratio_req,stop_ratio,...
            restart,apratios,limit_state,h_stat_mes);
        Analysis.RunAnalysis();
        [DEFL, REACT, ELE_FOR, AFLAG, APRATIOS, LIMIT_STATE] = Analysis.GetMastan2Returns();

% 	%AFLAG = inf;

%% Diagnostic tools
%
%   To use the diagnostic tools:
%       1. Comment out your code in the section above,
%       2. Set your preferences about what you want displayed in the Matlab Command Window during the
%          analysis, and
%       3. Uncomment the code below the preferences.
%
%   For this to work, ensure that the following files are in Matlab's path:
%       RC_Analysis_2d2el.p
%       RC_Element_2d2el.p
%       RC_Node_2d2el.p
