# Non Linear Analysis Toolbox

Introduction;

The code executes nonlinear analyses of 2-D structures by assimilating the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Inheritance. It is an extension of the first order analyses codes by incorporating the concepts of geometric nonlinearity of structural analysis through the implementation of simple step forward incremental method. However, as the first order codes were provided at an input to this assignment, a lot of emphasis is given to the efficient use of Inheritance which enables the use of many data properties and methods that have previously been defined in the in the parent class and is not needed to modified by the child class.
